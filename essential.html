              <p class="description">A defined playing area for basketball, shaped rectangularly and marked with specific boundaries, lines, and markings, is referred to as a basketball court. The platform is offered for gameplay, allowing participants to exhibit their abilities and engage in competition. Located at both sides of the court are hoop or rim installations positioned 10 feet (3. 05 meters) high from the surface. The aim of the game is to earn points through successful attempts of shooting the ball into the adversary's basket. A spherical object exclusively tailored for basketball is utilized as the game ball. Generally, it is crafted from either genuine or artificial materials. The foundation of basketball is the court and equipment which allow players to participate in the fast-paced and exciting sport.</p>
